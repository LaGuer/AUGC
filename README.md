# AUGC

RNA nucleotides Mass Ratio using natural units (mol,GeV,m_n,m_p,m_e)

We’re checking two equations: (1) C + G = A + U + 15 (2) A + U = C + G – 15

For each of our six columns, we compute the sum of (A+U) and (C+G), then the difference.

ACGU (RNA):
A-U Pairing: Adenine (A) and Uridine (U) pair similarly to A-T, with slightly higher mass for U compared to T, indicating RNA's distinct functional characteristics.

C-G Pairing: Cytosine (C) and Guanine (G) in RNA retain their heavier molar mass contributions, emphasizing structural stability.
